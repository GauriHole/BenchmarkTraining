# üìå DBMS Assignments Repository

Welcome to the **DBMS Assignments Repository**! This repository contains various project files related to **Database Management System (DBMS)** concepts, including **ERDs, SQL commands, normalization, joins, views, and transaction management**. You can continue adding new assignments and projects in the future.

## üöÄ DBMS Concepts Covered

- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: Designing database schemas
- **Normalization**: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
- **SQL Commands**:
  - **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`
  - **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
  - **DQL (Data Query Language)**: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`
  - **DCL (Data Control Language)**: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
- **Joins in SQL**: Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join, Cross Join
- **Views & Stored Procedures**: Creating and using database views
- **Indexes & Performance Optimization**: Using indexes to optimize queries
- **Transaction Management**: ACID properties, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT
- **Triggers & Constraints**: Implementing database triggers and constraints

## üìù Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Running SQL Scripts
Make sure you have a **MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle** database installed. Execute SQL scripts using:
```sql
source filename.sql;
```
Or use the database client to run queries.
